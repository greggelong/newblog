title: found my old static blog
---

While going through my many repositories I came across this old abandoned blog. I created it five years ago when I was just starting to use github to save my code. I was using jekyll locally on a linux machine to preview my blog posts. But now I am simply creating them in VS code and publishing them to the github page.

Strange that I happened to stumble upon this at 5 yeas later almost to the day.  5 years ago I created it on my birthday.
